## Introduction

In a world where cloud services dominate, self-hosting offers flexibility and control. This repository aims to provide a robust framework for deploying services in your homelab using Kubernetes. You can easily adapt the configurations to suit your needs.

## Features

- **Production-ready Configurations**: All configurations are tested and ready for production use.
- **Easy Deployment**: Simplified deployment processes using Helm and Kustomize.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Built-in support for Grafana and Prometheus to keep an eye on your services.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamless integration with ArgoCD and Flux for GitOps workflows.
- **SSL Management**: Use Cert-Manager for automatic SSL certificate provisioning.
- **Load Balancing**: Leverage MetalLB for load balancing in your homelab.

## Technologies Used

This repository includes configurations for various tools and technologies:

- **Kubernetes**: The core platform for container orchestration.
- **Helm**: A package manager for Kubernetes.
- **Kustomize**: A tool for customizing Kubernetes YAML configurations.
- **ArgoCD**: A declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
- **Flux**: Another GitOps tool for managing Kubernetes resources.
- **Cert-Manager**: A tool for managing SSL certificates.
- **Grafana**: A visualization tool for monitoring.
- **Prometheus**: A powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- **Ingress-NGINX**: A robust ingress controller for Kubernetes.
- **MetalLB**: A load balancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Homelab Kubernetes Services, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Galiwango001/homelab-k8s-services.git
   cd homelab-k8s-services
   ```

2. **Install Required Tools**:
   Ensure you have the following tools installed:
   - `kubectl`
   - `helm`
   - `kustomize`
   - `argocd` (if using ArgoCD)
   - `flux` (if using Flux)

3. **Set Up Your Kubernetes Cluster**:
   You can use any Kubernetes provider, such as Minikube, GKE, or EKS. Ensure your cluster is up and running.

## Usage

To use the configurations in this repository, navigate to the specific service you want to deploy. Each service folder contains a `README.md` file with detailed instructions.

### Example: Deploying Grafana

1. **Navigate to the Grafana Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd grafana
   ```

2. **Deploy Using Helm**:
   ```bash
   helm install grafana ./grafana
   ```

3. **Access Grafana**:
   Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to access the Grafana dashboard.

## Configuration

Each service has its own configuration files. You can customize these files based on your requirements. The configurations typically include:

- **Deployment YAML**: Defines the deployment settings for the service.
- **Service YAML**: Specifies how the service is exposed.
- **Ingress YAML**: Manages the ingress routing for the service.

### Example Configuration for Ingress

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.local
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: example-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

## Monitoring

Monitoring is crucial for maintaining the health of your services. This repository includes configurations for Prometheus and Grafana. 

### Setting Up Prometheus

1. **Navigate to the Prometheus Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd prometheus
   ```

2. **Deploy Prometheus**:
   ```bash
   helm install prometheus ./prometheus
   ```

3. **Access Prometheus**:
   Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to access the Prometheus dashboard.

## Deploying Services

You can deploy multiple services using the configurations provided. Each service is modular and can be deployed independently.

### Example: Deploying a Web Application

1. **Navigate to the Web Application Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd web-app
   ```

2. **Deploy the Application**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

3. **Check the Status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```
